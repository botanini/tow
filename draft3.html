      <p>
        Some may ask me why and how I’ve reached this far in documenting my
        trash. At first, it seemed like a simple exercise. But over time, it has
        evolved into something much deeper. This project has given me a unique
        window into my habits, revealing how much I tend to accumulate and how
        often I overlook the true cost of the things I buy. Each week, as I
        photograph and reflect on the items I discard, I’m confronted with the
        stories behind them. Why did I acquire this? How did it serve me? And
        why am I letting it go now? These questions have led me to think more
        critically about my choices, not just as a consumer but as someone who
        is part of a larger ecosystem.
      </p>
      <p>
        By sharing this journey, I hope to do more than just document my trash.
        I want to spark conversations about sustainability, mindfulness, and the
        often-overlooked value of the things we discard. It’s easy to think of
        trash as something that simply disappears once it’s out of sight, but
        every item has a history and a future. Whether it ends up in a landfill,
        a recycling center, or a secondhand store, its journey doesn’t end when
        we let it go. This project has become a way for me to take
        responsibility for my role in that journey. It’s also a reminder that
        small, intentional changes can add up over time. By reflecting on what I
        throw away, I’m learning to make better choices about what I bring into
        my life in the first place. And by sharing these reflections, I hope to
        inspire others to do the same.

      <!-- Overview Section -->
      <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        This week was a mix of random things left from parties, some old items
        that I have forgotten about, and a few surprises. Compared to last week,
        which was full of cleaning out old paperwork and books, this week felt
        more personal. I found myself parting with items tied to memories, like
        the Spiderman piñata from a birthday party and a deck of cards that has
        seen countless game nights. At the same time, I disposed of everyday
        essentials like a worn-out face mask and an empty tissue box.
      </p>

      <h3>Items Overview</h3>
      <p>The items this week fell into three distinct categories:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>All Fun and Games (Party & Games):</strong>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playing_card" target="_blank"
            >Deck of Cards</a
          >,
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi%C3%B1ata" target="_blank"
            >Spiderman Piñata</a
          >,
          <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Trading_Card_Game"
            target="_blank"
            >Pokemon Cards</a
          >,
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_envelope" target="_blank"
            >Red Packets</a
          >
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong
            >The Weather Is Getting Cold, and I’m Getting Sick (Health
            Related):</strong
          >
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_mask" target="_blank"
            >Face Mask</a
          >,
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_paper" target="_blank"
            >Tissue Box</a
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Didn’t Realize I Still Had This? (Forgotten Items):</strong>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receipt" target="_blank"
            >Old Receipts</a
          >,
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makeup" target="_blank"
            >Empty Makeup</a
          >,
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribbon" target="_blank"
            >Ribbon</a
          >
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        First group is “All fun and games” or the items that were leftover from
        parties, random game nights, or just simply entertainment. We have first
        these cards with the Hello Panda branding all over it. I received this
        from a pop up event with my friends. The cards were used for many games,
        such as poker (for fun not actual gambling), BS, Egyptian Rat Screw, and
        other games. I’m throwing them away after they’ve seen a bit too many
        games, and we have purchased a new set of cards as well so there was no
        need to keep the cards around. Then I have a spiderman pinata that was
        bought for my roommate's birthday cause she really likes spiderman. This
        spiderman was hanging for a long time and lasted until the end of the
        break as a very interesting decoration. We are tossing it due to it just
        taking up too much space. These are some pokemon cards that I got from
        the McDonalds and pokemon collaboration. It was fun opening this with my
        friends and looking at what cards we all got. I’m giving this away to my
        friends who like pokemon more. Then lastly we have the red packets,
        which look like red envelopes with gold foil on top. I got this quite
        literally yesterday at the time of writing this from my family. I’m
        tossing the packets away as there’s really no other usage for them after
        I receive them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Second group is the “The Weather Is Getting Cold, and I’m Getting Sick”
        also known as Health Related items. Starting off with the first item,
        face mask, I got this a while back when I first had covid last semester.
        I had gotten this from one of my roommates. Sadly now that I have used
        it I am throwing it away. Then we have the tissue box, which I used up
        as the weather has changed, I got sick. I’m getting rid of this as it's
        empty.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thirdly, the last group is “Didn’t Realize I Still Had This?” or the
        items that I have forgotten to throw away. The old receipts are from a
        mix of grocery shopping and buying food when eating out. The empty
        makeup is from a long time ago but I haven’t gotten rid of it. Then
        lastly this ribbon was found and I haven’t gotten around to getting rid
        of it.

        <i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i> Item of the Week: Red Packets
      </h2>
      <p>
        Red Packets will be the focus of this week! I selected this item as I
        feel like there is a lot to learn about this item’s history. Along with
        the timing just seems very fitting considering how important this event
        is to my family and culture.

      <h3>Memoir</h3>
      <p>
        I received these red packets during this year’s Chinese New Year
        celebrations from my family members. Each one was filled with money, a
        tradition meant to bring luck and blessings for the year ahead. But I
        don’t have that many reasons to keep the packets after taking the money
        out, so I will be throwing them away. This is a means to declutter, but
        I am very appreciative of the generosity and hope that the year to come
        will have a lot of fortune ahead.
      </p>
      <h3>Research</h3>
      <p>
        Red packets, or “hongbao”, have a rich history in Chinese culture.
        Traditionally, they were used to ward off evil spirits by placing coins
        in red envelopes. The reason for them being red is due to the fact that,
        in China, red is fire and is a symbol of joy, happiness, success, and
        good fortune. So they are a symbol of good luck and are often given
        during holidays and special occasions. There are also tips that can be
        seen on how to give red packets to others.

        This week’s trash reminded me of the balance between holding onto
        traditions and letting go of clutter. As I look ahead to next week, I
        hope to focus on reducing waste and being more mindful of what I bring
        into my life. Thank you for joining me on this journey. Feel free to
        share your thoughts or your own trash stories in the comments! Hope
        everyone has a Happy Chinese New Year! Let me know if you celebrate!

        Hi, I’m Lily Yang. I'm a junior studying Computer Science and
        Information Technology and Informatics at Rutgers University. I enjoy
        drawing and creating art, I made this graphic that you see above! I love
        playing video games and enjoy watching shows. One of the latest things
        that I have watched was Alice in Borderland. It’s a very interesting
        show and I would recommend if you are not like a child. It does have
        some explicit scenes and a good amount of blood, so proceed with
        caution. On the weekends, I play dungeons and dragons with my high
        school friends. My favorite animal is a penguin. For a penguin is like a
        bird in a suit which I think makes them superior than other birds. One
        of my future goals is to create a game fully from scratch. If you want
        to you can check out some more of my art on my Instagram:
