      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to my about page. Wasn't expecting anyone to want to read more
        about me. Trash of the Week was a very interesting project to work on. I
        learned a lot about myself and my habits. I hope you enjoyed reading
        about it as much as I enjoyed working on it.
      </p>

      <p>
        But, since you are here! Here are some random facts about me:
        <ul>
          <li>I love to draw</li>
          <li>My favorite show is Mob Psycho.</li>
          <li>Favorite Game is Omori</li>
          <li>I am a big fan of the color green</li>
          <li>I detest bitter melon.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Here is a drawing I made of me as a worm, touching grass and enjoying
        life under the sun, as a reward for making it this far.
