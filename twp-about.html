      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to my about page. Wasn't expecting anyone to want to read more
        about me. Trash of the Week was a very interesting project to work on. 
        I
        learned a lot about myself and my habits. I hope you enjoyed reading
        about it as much as I enjoyed working on it.
      </p>

        But, since you are here! Here are some random facts about me:
        I enjoy drawing and creating art, I made this graphic that you see above! I love
        playing video games and enjoy watching shows. One of the latest things
        that I have watched was Alice in Borderland. Itâ€™s a very interesting
        show and I would recommend if you are not like a child. It does have
        some explicit scenes and a good amount of blood, so proceed with
        caution. On the weekends, I play dungeons and dragons with my high
        school friends. My favorite animal is a penguin. For a penguin is like a
        bird in a suit which I think makes them superior than other birds. One
        of my future goals is to create a game fully from scratch.
        <ul>
          <li>I love to draw, I do both digital and physical</li>
          <li>My favorite show is Mob Psycho.</li>
          <li>Favorite Game is Omori, but I play a lot of other games.</li>
          <li>I am a big fan of the color green</li>
          <li>I detest bitter melon.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

        If you want
        to you can check out some more of my art on my Instagram:
        <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sheep.posts/">@sheep.posts</a>. 
        Here is a drawing I made of me as a worm, touching grass and enjoying
        life under the sun, as a reward for making it this far.
