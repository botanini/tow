    <h3>Expanded Preface</h3>
    <p>
      Some may ask me why and how I’ve reached this far in documenting my trash.
      At first, it seemed like a simple exercise. But over time, it has evolved
      into something much more profound. This project has given me a unique
      window into my habits, revealing how much I tend to accumulate and how
      often I overlook the actual cost of the things I buy. As I photograph and
      reflect on the items I discard each week, I’m confronted with the stories
      behind them. Why did I acquire this? How did it serve me? And why am I
      letting it go now? Especially after reading about

        >Sarah Newman's thoughts and work</a
      > I have been thinking more in depth on my own perception. These questions have led me to think more critically
      about my choices, not just as a consumer but as a part of a larger
      ecosystem.

    <p>Like imagine you were a sad polar bear on a piece of ice just because people did not try to be mindful or concious of their actions and the larger picture of the world around us.

    <p>
      By sharing this journey, I hope to do more than just document my trash. I
      want to have conversations about sustainability, mindfulness, and the
      often-overlooked value of the things we discard. It’s easy to think of
      trash as something that disappears once it’s out of sight, but every item
      has a history and a future. 
      <br>
      <br>Whether it ends up in a landfill, a recycling
      center, or a secondhand store, its journey doesn’t end when we let it go.
      This project has become a way for me to take responsibility for my role in
      that journey. It’s also a reminder that small, intentional changes can add
      up over time. By reflecting on what I throw away, I’m learning to make
      better choices about what I bring into my life in the first place.
    </p>
    <h3>Some other perspectives around</h3>
    <p>
      Another perspective that ties with my project is that of Brian Thill.
      Thill explores the multifaceted nature of waste, emphasizing that trash is
      a byproduct of consumption and a reflection of personal and societal
      values. Thill’s insights help contextualize these tendencies, illustrating
      how we form attachments to objects even as we prepare to discard them. His
      exploration of digital waste provides insight on how different forms of
      garbage tell stories about our habits, priorities, and the passage of
      time. Instead of viewing all waste as inherently harmful, it suggests that
      it can hold meaning, serving as a record of our lives. This perspective
      furthers the idea that documenting my trash is not merely about what is
      thrown away but about understanding the more profound implications of my
      consumption and disposal patterns. 
    </br>An interview with Brian Thill can be found
      <a href="https://fallowmedia.com/2016/feb/waste/">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although my project contains elements of raising awareness about waste, it
      is primarily an introspective and artistic endeavor. My focus is not on
      the broad environmental activism but on self-reflection. Diving into the
      more profound implications of my interactions with objects, the reasoning
      behind my purchases, consumption, and disposal. The personal aspect of
      this project is central to its purpose, prioritizing an exploration of my
      behaviors rather than directing attention outward.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this regard, my work aligns with the ideas of artist Vik Muniz, whose
      projects explore the relationship between objects, memory, and value. By
      photographing and analyzing the things I throw away, I am not merely
      cataloging waste; I am constructing a record of my habits, choices, and
      cultural or personal significance by framing discarded objects as
      artifacts of my personal history. I encourage both myself and others to
      engage in a more critical examination of what we consume and discard. Just
      as Muniz’s work encourages viewers to see beauty and value in the
      overlooked, I hope my project prompts others to question their own
      consumption habits and consider the broader implications of waste.

    <h3>Exploring the potential of waste</h3>
    <p>
      One of the most significant waste products of the twentieth century was
      plastic. This article dives into how plastic is used in asphalt mix. The
      New York Department of Transportation and Rutgers University are observing
      the performance of two roads in Staten Island that are using this plastic
      waste. This is a great way to see how something that is considered waste
      and trash is a potentially helpful resource that allows for it to be used
      beyond just being a single-use product. While this is just one potential
      viable renewed usage of the waste, they are still in the research phase to
      ensure there are no issues with the potential of microplastics being
      present. 
      <br/>

      <br/>
      I found this online project called  <a href="https://www.terracycle.com/en-US/">TerraCycle</a> that promotes the
      idea of eliminating the concept of waste. They focus on partnering with
      brands to create free recycling programs, and they promote different items
      and recycling programs. While this project does not focus on the concept
      of trash and waste from a different perspective, it dives into the steps
      to help make waste management more readily available for everyone.
    </p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
      Ultimately, my project serves as a form of personal introspection. I am
      constructing a narrative about consumption, memory, and responsibility
      through documentation and reflection. Whether through art, environmental
      activism, or technological innovation, examining our relationship with
      discarded materials offers valuable insights into both individual and
      collective behaviors. 
      <br/>
      <br/>
      The numerous possibilities currently being developed
      in hopes of reducing and recontextualizing how waste is more than just
      waste is being created worldwide. Many places are trying to address the
      overconsumption issue of the modern-day society, and my project does not
      follow the same type of trying to reduce these issues. In my own way, I
      reflect upon my habits and try to improve. And by sharing these
      reflections, I hope to inspire others to do the same.
